# ðŸ”¢ C++ Experiment 3  
## Conditional Statements & Decision Making

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Aim

Use conditional (if, else if, else) statements in C++ to:

- Determine grade based on average marks  
- Identify the quadrant of a point in 2D space  
- Check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero  

---

### ðŸ§  Objectives

âœ… Understand and implement conditional logic using C++ if-else constructs  
âœ… Apply decision-making to real-world problems  
âœ… Develop programs to analyze numeric data and provide descriptive output  
âœ… Gain confidence in nested and multi-branch conditional statements

### ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **Compiler:** g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)  
- **Editor/IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Operating System:** Windows 10

### ðŸ“˜ Algorithm Explanation

#### âž¤ Grade Calculator

1. Start the program  
2. Declare variables for 5 subjects: math, english, chemistry, physics, history  
3. Take user input for marks  
4. Calculate total: `total = math + english + chemistry + physics + history`  
5. Compute average: `average = total / 5.0`  
6. Use conditionals to assign grades:  
   - O if 80 â‰¤ average â‰¤ 90  
   - A+ if 70 â‰¤ average < 80  
   - A if 60 â‰¤ average < 70  
   - B if 50 â‰¤ average < 60  
   - C if 40 â‰¤ average < 50  
   - F if average < 40  
7. Display total, average, and grade  
8. End program  

#### âž¤ Quadrant Identifier

1. Start the program  
2. Input x and y coordinates  
3. Use conditionals:  
   - First Quadrant: x > 0 and y > 0  
   - Second Quadrant: x < 0 and y > 0  
   - Third Quadrant: x < 0 and y < 0  
   - Fourth Quadrant: x > 0 and y < 0  
   - Origin: x == 0 and y == 0  
   - Y-axis: x == 0 and y â‰  0  
   - X-axis: y == 0 and x â‰  0  
4. Display result  
5. End program  

#### âž¤ Number Sign Checker

1. Start the program  
2. Input a number  
3. Use conditionals:  
   - If number > 0 â†’ Positive  
   - If number < 0 â†’ Negative  
   - If number == 0 â†’ Zero  
4. Display result  
5. End program

### âœ… Conclusion

This experiment introduced the use of conditional statements in C++ and demonstrated their application in real-world logical problems.
